1) create ant file to build a jar-file that can be exported into other applications

2) add reporting of pressure and torque from the cpn model. 
  Could be done by server push or via a request/response from the client in 
  combination with a poll transition and use of canreceive in the server side

3) extend the example client-server session such that 
    - a session can be terminated (but connection remains for a new session?)
    - the client can close the connection, but the server remains running
    - the client can terminate the server by terminate session + close connection 
    
 4) generalise the client side session implementation such that it is possible to
   have the server be running on a different machine and not only localhost
   
 5) add  JavaDoc to the Comms/CPN and session layer
 
 6) add the Comms/CPN SML side to the repository on the client side
